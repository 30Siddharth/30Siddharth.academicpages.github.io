Hello!
I am Ph.D. student in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department, University of Virginia.

My research is focused on robotic systems. I work primarily with robotic perception and controls for dynamical system. The problems that I tackle lie at the confluence of optimization, decision theory and information fusion. My aim is to develop the research skills and a robust knowledge base to be able to work with the complete stack of robots in manufacturing settings. Currently, my research has focused at improving grasping techniques for robotic manipulators using surface characteristics and utilizing perception for robotic learning.

I completed my Masters' in Mechanical Engineering (Robotics and Mechatronic systems) from the University of Pennsylvania. Here I worked and learned about several aspects of robotics such as, optimal control, motion planning, path planning, and state estimation. 

I finished my B.E. from Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, University of Delhi in Manufacturing Process and Automation Engineering. I worked on developing a solar car which was the fastest solar car made in India. The efforts of the team were recongnized by the Office of the Hon' Prime Minister of India. 

I like solving puzzles, playing badminton or football, and reading books in my free time.

*This is my new wesbite and it is still under works. Some of the information is missing. If you are interested to know more, please feel free to drop me an email.*
