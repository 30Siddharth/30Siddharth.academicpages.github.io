Hello!
I am Ph.D. student in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department, University of Virginia.

My research is focused on robotic systems. I have worked on problems ranging from design & fabrication to perception & learning. In general, I enjoy working on problems which requires one to identify underlying structures and transferring analogies. I currently focus on long-horizon task and motion planning for robotic systems. 

I completed my M.S.E in Mechanical Engineering (Robotics and Mechatronic systems) from the University of Pennsylvania. Here I worked and learned about several aspects of robotics such as, optimal control, motion planning, path planning, and state estimation. 

I finished my B.E. from Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, University of Delhi in Manufacturing Process and Automation Engineering. I lead a team to develop a Solar Electric Vehicle which was the fastest solar car made in India. The efforts of the team were recongnized by the Office of the Hon' Prime Minister of India. 

I like solving puzzles, playing badminton or football, and reading books in my free time.
