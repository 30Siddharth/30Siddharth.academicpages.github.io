Hello!
I am Ph.D. student at [Victor Lab](https://www.victor-uva.org/) in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department, University of Virginia. My advisor is [Dr. Tomonari Furukawa](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/tomonari-furukawa).

My research is focused on robotic systems. I work primarily with high precision mapping, perception and controls. The problems that I tackle lie at the confluence of optimization, decision theory and information fusion. My aim is to develop the research skills and a robust knowledge base to be able to work with the complete stack in a mobile robot. Currently, I am involved in two projects, multi-robot cooperation and vision based high precision measurement setups. 

Before joining the lab I completed my Masters' in Mechanical Engineering (Robotics and Mechatronic systems) from the University of Pennsylvania. Here worked on studying the verifiability of NN-based system identification tool. 

I like solving puzzles, playing badminton, and reading books in my free time.
