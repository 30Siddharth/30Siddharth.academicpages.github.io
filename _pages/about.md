Hello!
I am Ph.D. student in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department, University of Virginia. My advisor is [Prof. Cindy Chang](https://isl-uva.github.io/team/cindy-chang)

The PDF of my [*CV*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dr9xlVpl4OTxIDJ92QD2gsH4p8TqUBq5/view?usp=sharing).

My research is focused on robotic systems. I have worked on problems ranging from design & fabrication to perception & learning. I currently focus on long-horizon task and motion planning for robotic systems. 

I completed my M.S.E in Mechanical Engineering (Robotics and Mechatronic systems) from the *University of Pennsylvania*. Here I worked and learned about several aspects of robotics such as, optimal control, motion planning, path planning, and state estimation. I finished my B.E. from *Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology*, University of Delhi in Manufacturing Process and Automation Engineering. I lead a team to develop a Solar Electric Vehicle which was the fastest solar car made in India. The efforts of the team were recongnized by the Office of the Hon' Prime Minister of India. 

I like solving puzzles, playing badminton or football, and reading books in my free time.
