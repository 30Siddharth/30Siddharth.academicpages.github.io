Hello!
I am Ph.D. student at [Victor Lab](https://www.victor-uva.org/) in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department, University of Virginia. My advisor is [Dr. Tomonari Furukawa](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/tomonari-furukawa). I passed my qualifier exam in September 2022.

Check out the PDF of my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jCUgp8DP6XjSHzLD8XMzDsKY9_uXlNk3/view?usp=share_link) here.

My research is focused on robotic systems. I work primarily with robotic perception and controls for dynamical system. The problems that I tackle lie at the confluence of optimization, decision theory and information fusion. My aim is to develop the research skills and a robust knowledge base to be able to work with the complete stack in a mobile robot. Currently, my research has focused at improving grasping techniques for robotic manipulators using surface characteristics.

Before joining the lab I completed my Masters' in Mechanical Engineering (Robotics and Mechatronic systems) from the University of Pennsylvania. Here worked on studying the verifiability of NN-based system identification tool. 

I like solving puzzles, playing badminton or football, and reading books in my free time.

*This is my new wesbite and it is still under works. Some of the information is missing. If you are interested to know more, please feel free to drop me an email.*
