# High Precision 3D Reconstruction
We are surrounded by several objects with different characteristics. They can vary based on both material and the object geometry. 
3D reconstruction allows robots or machines to accese high-fidleity information. High resolution measurement using active lighting has been 
a pivot of my research during my Ph.D. The aim is to use controlled lighting (and preferablly uncontrolled lighting conditions) to measure 
features with sub-millimeter resolution.
