Autonomous Systems, Mobile Robots, Path Planning, Motion Planning, Navigation, 3D Reconstruction\

As robots make their way into our daily lives, one of the primary goals is to make them more independent. An essential aspect of this problem is to devise reliable methods combining cognitive decision-making with dynamical systems. My research lies at the confluence of dynamical system planning and modeling information gained from machine vision. Specifically, I am interested in developing novel sensing abstractions and studying how to leverage the gained information to improve the physical interaction between robots and their surroundings. I wish to study the comparisons between integrating implicit understanding and explicit modeling (probabilistic/deterministic) into the planning stage of dynamic tasks while trying to quantify the feasibility of the tasks. Examples of such problems are but are not limited to, robotic grasping, heterogeneous material manipulation, texture-aware gripping, and mobile manipulation. I will use my research to make robots more reliable, achieving their assigned task safely with little or no supervision while being *mindful* of their surroundings, especially the humans.
