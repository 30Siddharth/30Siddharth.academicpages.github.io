Research Interests
===
Autonomous Systems, Mobile Robots, Reinforcement Learning, Path Planning, Motion Planning, Navigation, 3D Reconstruction\

My research focuses on developing solutions for robotic problems which can be implemented in real-life environments. The emphasis of my research is to reduce computation for long horizon planning tasks by leveraging human demonstrations, diffusion models and hierarchical learning.
