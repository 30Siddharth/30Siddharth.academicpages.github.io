* Robotic Learning
My current research focuses on learning based planning and controls of robots. You can more about my research on [our lab website.](https://isl-uva.github.io/projects/)

* [Multi Robot Mapping](/_pages/MultiRobo_projects.md)
Another project that I have worked towards is the multi-robot mapping. Mapping large environment can be painstaking and time consuming process. In our project we are working towards developing a multirobot setup for the purpose of mapping and planning tasks with a team of robots.  

* [Path Planning](https://sites.google.com/seas.upenn.edu/30siddharth/projects/autonomous-uav?authuser=0)
Planning and controls are at the heart of autonomous systems. The problems in this field can vary a lot and the biggest task being able to handle the steep climb in the complexity, both in terms of implementation and conceptualization. The outcome is equally satistfying. I have had the opportunity to work with planning algorithms at both the levels. In brief I have worked with 3 major types of planning algorithms:
    + Vector Field (Attraction based)
    + Graph Search (A-star, Dijsktra, RRT, RRT-star)
    + Optimal Path (Planning in continous state space)

* [NN Based System Identification](https://sites.google.com/seas.upenn.edu/30siddharth/projects/optimal-controls-graph-search-state-estimation?authuser=0)
System Identification has been studied in great depth in the field of controls theory. In this project my aim to discover the ability of a neural netwrok to learn the dynamics of a Unamanned Underwater Vehicle. The dynamics of a UUV can very complicated. For the purpose of the study, the NN was trained with simple predictable trajectories which was tested against the PRBS excited model.
  

* Mechatronics
Here a few videos showing the mechatronic projects I have worked on in the past.
